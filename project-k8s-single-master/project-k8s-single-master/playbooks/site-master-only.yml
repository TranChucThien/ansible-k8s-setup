# Master-Only Kubernetes Deployment
# =============================================================================
# Purpose: Deploy only master node without any worker nodes
#
# Use cases:
# - Development/testing environments
# - Single-node clusters
# - Initial master setup before adding workers later
# - Learning and experimentation
#
# What this playbook does:
# 1. Common setup for master node (Docker, Kubernetes packages, networking)
# 2. Master node initialization with kubeadm and Calico CNI
# 3. Configures kubectl access for the ansible user
#
# Requirements:
# - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS master node
# - SSH access to master node
# - Inventory file with [masters] group configured
#
# Usage:
# ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/site-master-only.yml
#
# Expected result:
# - Single-node Kubernetes cluster (master can schedule pods)
# - kubectl configured and ready to use
# - Calico networking installed
